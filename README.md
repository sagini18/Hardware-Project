# Hardware-Project
First-year hardware project - Anti-sleep alarm with alcohol and flame detection
# Introduction
All over the world, ever-increasing numbers of traffic accidents are occurred due to the
driverâ€™s drowsiness and alcohol usage, and fire accidents. Sleep-related accidents tend to
be more severe, possibly because of the higher speeds involved and the driver cannot take
any avoiding action, or even brake, before the collision. And also, a considerable part of
the traffic accident has some correlation with drunk driving.
# Aim
Our project aims to reduce accidents caused by drowsiness, drunk
driving, and fire.
# Objectives
* To check whether the driver is sleeping or not.
* To check whether the driver has drunk or not.
* To reduce fire-based accidents.
* To inform his well-wishers about unstable situations.
* To identify the current location of vehicle in the unstable situations.
# Proposed Solution
Our system will use a flame sensor, pressure sensor, eye blinking sensor and gyroscope module
to check on the fire, speeding, and driver's eye and head movement respectively.

If the driver's sleepiness and fire detection conditions are met, it will display a warning message
and alert him by blinking hazard lights, Controlling the sound, and ringing the buzzer. If the driver
receives an alarm within 5 seconds, he must turn off the buzzer. If not, our system will use the
GPS module to identify the location and send it to a predetermined phone number via the
GSM/GPRS module. If the driver consumes alcohol which is sensed by a gas sensor, the
location will be sent to the predefined phone number.
